## Project Overview
* The start date of this project is Thursday, October 27, 2023.
* This project has two main goals:
    1. Study PyTorch consistently every day.
    2. Proficient handling of PyTorch without referring to books or posts.
        * Don't be overwhelmed when looking at PyTorch example codes on the internet.😂😂
* Content is organized in Jupyter notebook format, combining both code and explanations.
* We use Python (version 3.9.16) as the primary programming language, and any necessary libraries will be introduced on the respective pages.
